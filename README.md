# Text Classification: Comparative Analysis of Different Deep Neural Network Architectures

This project was done as a part of CSC 591: ADBI. As a part of this project, we developed and compared the following 3 deep neural network architectures for the task of text classification. 
1. CNN: Convolutional Neural Networks
2. RNN: Recurrent Neural Networks
3. HAN: Hierarchical Attention Networks
